Creating user stories is important in order to implement customer needs into the program. It is needed to understand how to improve the software or program. When a user is able to identify issues within the system they are able to provide these user stories to the development team so that they an see what works and what doesnt work. Ater the development team interprets the customer needs they can use that to improve in their program for the better.
I would choose to use the agile method. This method in my opinion is better because it allows for more adaptability and flexibility. This flexibility makes it easier to adapt to the customer needs as they arise. It also is easier to go back and review previously worked sections unlike with the waterfall method.
I believe communication is key to being a good team memeber. Being a good team member is someone who is able to be involved and have no issues with communication. Challenges can arise at any part of the software development. If your team mate is able to communicate the issues they are facing or any changes that need to be made is a benefit in order to keeo the process moving smoothly. This can eliminate any double work.
